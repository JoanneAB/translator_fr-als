\section{Introduction}
The goal of the "Deep learning with Python" course's project is to train a language model on a translation task 
between two languages. Because of my Alsatians origins, I chose to work on the translation from French to 
Alsatian, a French regional dialiect in Alsace (North-East of France). Alsatian dialect is a non-standard, spoken 
language with limited written ressources. After a thorough research, no pre-trained transformer exists, to my 
knowledge, for a French to Alsatian translation task. Therefore the dataset gathering task must be carefully 
executed to develop a robust model. 

This report presents the steps undertaken to perform this study: data collection, database pre-processing, 
model fine-tuning and model evaluation.
